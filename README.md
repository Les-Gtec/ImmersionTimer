# MQTT / WeMos based Immersion Heater Timer

Personal use project to control a dual coil Immersion heater for hot water.

*NOTE* The hardware for this project involves switching high current loads at mains voltage, your on your own :-)

## Getting Started

The code depends on credentials in a library file called credentials.h that is not included in source control. there is a sample file that you can use to create your own.
I run the software on a Wemos D1 Pro board.
